What doesnt work?

We had a bug when trying to upload a file using Golem’s computing power. The issue was that Golem API was returning this
error: “GolemWorkError: Script initialization failed for command: {"transfer":{"to":"container:
/golem/input/test.sh"}}. {"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":"55543ef2-dad5-4d7c-ba04-408f8861c07e","err │ or":{"code":-32000,"
message":"Called service /local/identity/Get is unavailable"}}"”

After doing some digging around we found that other users had this issue on Discord. The staff member managed to point
us in the right direction on Sunday morning. But didn't have time.
